# Hi there, I'm Edwin Ahlstrand ðŸ‘‹

## Abut me ðŸ˜ƒ
I'm a university student at KTH since 2021 and my goal is to graduate with a master in computer science.

## Experience ðŸŽ“
I have experience in:
- Java
- C#
- C
- MIPS Assembly
- Prolog
- Elixir
- HTML and CSS

## My work ðŸ’»

### [PongDeluxe](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/IS1200-PongDeluxe)
My most ambitious project is developing the game pong on a microcontroller with basic IO in C. I was responsible for:
- Overal structure of the code
- Menu
- AI
- States
- Leaderboard

But I also helped a bit with the rest when I could.

### [Natural deduction proof verifier](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/DD1351-Task-2) and [CTL verifier](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/DD1351-Task-3) 
Both of the projects where developed in Prolog. I was responsible for the overal code structure and wrote about half of the neccesary rules needing to be verified in both cases while my labparter [@BaltzarL](https://github.com/BaltzarL) wrote the other half.

### Soundgood Music School [DB](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/IV1351-Soundgood-Music-DB) and [JDBC](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/IV1351-Task-4)
The DB was first planned in Astah with both a conceptual model and a logical/physical model which was converted to a PostgreSQL DB. Me and my labpartner [@BaltzarL](https://github.com/BaltzarL) took equal part in planning and drawing of the DB.

Afterwards, a JDBC for the DB was developed in Java. I wrote most of the code in the model-layer while my labpartner [@BaltzarL](https://github.com/BaltzarL) wrote most of the code in the controller-layer. 

### Java algorithms and data structures
I have published the three most interesting assignments from my course ID1021 where I developed and benchmarked different algorithms and data structures. 
These are:
- [Queues](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/ID1021-Queues)
- [Heap](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/ID1021-Heap)
- [Graphs](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/ID1021-Graphs)
