## My work ðŸ’»

### [PongDeluxe](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/IS1200-PongDeluxe)
My most ambitious project is developing the classic game pong on a microcontroller with basic IO in C. I was responsible for:
- Overal structure of the code
- Menu
- AI
- States
- Leaderboard
- Testing

But I was also involed a bit with the rest of the project when I could.


### [Natural Deduction Proof Verifier](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/DD1351-Task-2) & [Computational Tree Logic Verifier](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/DD1351-Task-3) 
Both of the projects where developed in Prolog. I was responsible for the overal code structure and wrote about half of the neccesary rules needing to be verified in both projects while my labparter [@BaltzarL](https://github.com/BaltzarL) wrote the other half.


### [Soundgood Music School DB](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/IV1351-Soundgood-Music-DB) & [JDBC](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/IV1351-Task-4)
The DB was first planned in Astah with both a conceptual model and a logical/physical model which was converted to a PostgreSQL DB. Me and my labpartner [@BaltzarL](https://github.com/BaltzarL) took equal part in planning and drawing of the DB.

Afterwards, a JDBC for the DB was developed in Java. I wrote most of the code in the model-layer while my labpartner [@BaltzarL](https://github.com/BaltzarL) wrote most of the code in the controller-layer. 


### Java Algorithms and Data Structures
I have published the three most interesting assignments from my course ID1021 where I developed and benchmarked different algorithms and data structures. 
These are:
- [Queues](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/ID1021-Queues)
- [Heap](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/ID1021-Heap)
- [Graphs](https://github.com/EdwinAhl/ID1021-Graphs)
